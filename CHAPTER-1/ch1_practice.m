% Practicing basic applications

%% --------------- STEP 1 --------------- %%
% [] Pick your favorite equation from another class, doesn't matter which one. 
% [] Declare each of the variables involved in that equation and assign an arbitrary value to each of them (refer to the way we defined the 'message' variable in the example script)
% [] Piece them together to calculate the result of your favorite equation and print it to the Command Window

%% --------------- STEP 2 --------------- %%
% [] Using the same equation, prompt the user to input values for each of the variables (look it up if you are not familiar with how to do this!)

%% --------------- BONUS --------------- %%
% [] Assign arbitrary values to all but one of the variables in your equation
% [] Declare the remaining variable as a vector of numbers (look up MATLAB vectors!)
% [] Piece them all together again (you may have to look up how to apply some operation to a vector)
% [] Observe that the output is no longer a single number, but a whole vector corresponding to all of your inputs!
