# Forces

### Textbook Learning Objectives
- Describe forces in terms of magnitude and direction
- Calculate the magnitude of a two- or three-dimensional vector given the constitutive x- and y- or x-, y-, and z-components respectively
- Identify the four main types of force vectors: concurrent, non-concurrent, parallel, and collinear forces, as well as the sub-types of parallel forces (i.e distrubuted forces in two- and three-dimensions)
- Perform vector arithmetic. In particular, determining the vector dot product (i.e. projection) for two- and three-dimensional vectors, and calculating the angle between vectors
- Perform vector arithmetic. In particular, addition and subtraction on the main types of force vectors.
- Apply the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines to triangles that can either represent forces or physical geometry

### MATLAB Parallel Objectives
- Vectors in MATLAB
- Vector operations: addition, subtraction, scalar product (dot product)
- Vector normalization, unit vectors
- Basic vectorized algorithms in MATLAB
- Trig (degrees vs radians)
