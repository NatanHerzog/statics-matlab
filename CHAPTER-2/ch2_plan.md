## Vectors in MATLAB

With pen and paper, we often write vectors as the following: $$\vec{v}=(a,b,c)$$ to represent the 3D spatial vector: $$\vec{v}= a\hat{i} + b\hat{j} + c\hat{k}$$

In MATLAB, we can do the same thing, but it is written as `v = [a,b,c]`. Vectors in MATLAB are super awesome and are really powerful in programming.
