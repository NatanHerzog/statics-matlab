% Practicing Vectors

%% --------------- STEP-BY-STEP 1 --------------- %%
% [] Recall the equation you used for ch1_practice.m
% [] Assign arbitrary values to all but one of the variables in your equation
% [] Declare the remaining variable as a vector of numbers (refer to ch2 documentation)
%       - You can do this manually or with one of the two automatic methods
% [] Piece the variables together according to your equation
%       - Pay attention to whether any of the operations should be "vectorized"
% [] Observe that the output is no longer a single number, but a whole vector corresponding to all of your inputs!

%% --------------- STEP-BY-STEP 2 --------------- %%
% [] Define unit direction vectors corresponding to each of the three cartesian axes (x, y, z)
% [] Now, perform the dot product between them
%       - Observe the result and consider its physical meaning (hint: think back to the angle formula!)
% [] By combining vector addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, create two new vectors in terms of the three unit direction vectors
% [] Calculate the dot and cross products for these two vectors
% [] Normalize each of them
% [] Calculate the angle formed between the two original vectors
% [] Calculate the angle formed between the two normalized vectors
