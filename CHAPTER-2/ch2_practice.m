% [] Assign arbitrary values to all but one of the variables in your equation
% [] Declare the remaining variable as a vector of numbers (look up MATLAB vectors!)
% [] Piece them all together again (you may have to look up how to apply some operation to a vector)
% [] Observe that the output is no longer a single number, but a whole vector corresponding to all of your inputs!
