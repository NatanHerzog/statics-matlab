# Moments

### Textbook Learning Objectives
- Understand the formulation of moments in two- and three-dimensions
- Determine the magnitude of moments as well as the direction of rotation
- Understand the vector product, i.e. cross-product, and how it relates to the formulation of couples and moments
- Understand the formulation of position vectors
- Be able to project a moment or couple onto a line
- Understand the difference between moments and couples
- Construct a force-couple equivalence

### MATLAB Parallel Objectives
- Vector operations: vector product (cross product)
- Vectorized cross products
