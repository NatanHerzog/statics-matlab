# Equilibrium

### Textbook Learning Objectives

- Represent physical systems in terms of equilibrium equations through the construction of free body diagrams (FBDs)
- Understand the basic types of support used when analyzing static structures
- Identify and understand the conditions for static structures to be in equilibrium in two- and three-dimensions
- Understand what it means for a body to be completely, partially, and improperly constrained, and how necessary and sufficient conditions are used to describe these situations
- Understand static and kinetic frictional forces

### MATLAB Parallel Objectives

- Systems of equations in matrix form
- Systems of equations in symbolic form
- Introduction to for loops when we reach for loops (function of theta)
