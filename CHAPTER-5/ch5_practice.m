%% Chapter 5 Practice Question

% ---------- STEP-BY-STEP MATRIX FORM ---------- %
% [] Refer to the image at the end of ch5_plan.md
% [] Write out the three equilibrium equations for:
%   [] Sum of forces in the x-direction, sigma_F_x
%   [] Sum of forces in the y-direction, sigma_F_y
%   [] Sum of moments about point B (counter-clockwise is positive)
% [] Re-arrange any equations to have all variables on the left and all known values on the right
% [] Write the system of equations in matrix form (Av=b):
%   [] A: coefficient matrix
%   [] v: variable vector
%   [] b: right-hand side of your equations
% [] Solve for the variable vector by inverting A (refer to ch5_plan.md if you don't remember how)

% ---------- STEP-BY-STEP SYMBOLICS FORM ---------- %
% [] Continue from writing the three equilibrium equations above
% [] Write all three equations in symbolic form
%   [] Make sure to declare all variables as symbolic variables
% [] Create the vector eqns to list all equations
% [] Create the vector vars to list all variables
% [] Solve the system using the symbolic function solve(eqns, vars)
