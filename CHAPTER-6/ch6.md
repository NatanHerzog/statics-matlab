# Stress and Strain

### Textbook Learning Objectives
- Determine the normal and shear stress generated within an axially loaded member, and where the maxima occur
- Determine if an axially loaded member is in compression or tension
- Determine the bearing stress within an axially loaded member
- Understand normal and shear strain
- Differentiate between average and true axial strain
- Understand the relationship between stress and strain for ductile materials, and identify key properties, such as the yield and ultimate stresses, as well as the linear elastic region on the stress-strain diagram for low-carbon steels and aluminum alloys
- Understand the relationship between shear stress and shear strain, and how they are related via the Shear Modulus
- Understand the formulation of Poisson's ratio and how it relates the Modulus of Elasticity to the Shear Modulus
- Calculate strain due to applied loading, as well as due to thermal effects, and how to convert strain into axial deformation
