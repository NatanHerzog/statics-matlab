% Chapter 6 Practice

% ----- STEP-BY-STEP EXAMPLE ----- %
% [] Define anonymous functions for calculating bearing stress and shearing stress
%   [] Be sure not to hard-code any values that may change later on, pass them as inputs
% [] Create a vector of possible values for the diameter (with highest value at the start)
% [] Define variables for the upper limits for both bearing and shearing stress
%     (given in the problem)
% [] Write a conditional while loop to sweep over the diametrical values defined previously
%   [] Make sure you account for both stress conditions in the loop heading
%   [] Within the loop body, calculate the both stresses present
%   [] Store each within a corresponding vector
% [] Plot the results of both stress values
%   [] It may be helpful to also include both of the stress limits as lines on the graph
%   [] Include a legend for yourself so that you can interpret the graph!
% [] Consider the meaning of the results. Do they match hand calculations?
