# statics-matlab
This repository will house all MATLAB-related content created for the Fall 2023 Statics and Mechanics of Materials 1 course at the University of Pittsburgh, taught by Dr. Matthew Barry. This repository is developed and maintained entirely by myself, Natan Herzog, as part of my fulfillment of the Chancellors Undergraduate Teaching Fellowship through the Frederick Honors College.

## Purpose
As part of my teaching fellowship through the Frederick Honors College, I am developing course content to enhance the regular Statics curriculum by introducing students to the power of MATLAB for both simple and complex tasks.

The primary motivation stems from my experiences as both a student and later as an undergradute teaching assistant, where it became apparent that most students are not comfortable enough with MATLAB to use it as an everyday tool, despite how simple homework assigments would be, and are not familiar enough with using it to solve problems to make robust solutions for the final course project.

Ultimately, students design, model, and build a bridge and are expected to demonstrate at least one attempt to iterate on their design. MATLAB can make this very easy, but we have historically not had the time during the semester to thoroughly introduce the necessary concepts, as they technically sit outside the course scope.

My goal for this semester is to walk through a series of "lessons" in how to use MATLAB to solve problems that build all of the skills necessary for a successful final project. This repository will contain that content.

## Approach
I believe the best way to learn how to code is to simply *do things*. Learning about coding fundamentals like `for` and `while` looping, `if` conditionals, or syntactic conventions is important, but lessons in them are both uninspiring and unhelpful in a class setting. As such, I will avoid such content.

Instead, my content will center around solving problems, in much the same ways that students are already familiar from class, but using MATLAB instead of hand calculations. The format will be collaborative, driven by the students. I may not even have my computer open, opting instead to illustrate what we are doing in code on the white board and to walk around with each of the students.

In this manner, we will gradually build a level of comfort with things like:

- creating and running custom MATLAB Scripts
- solving systems of equations
- simple structural loading / stress analysis
- iterative design optimization

It is my hope that those students who choose to engage with my content throughout the semester will be comfortable with tackling the development of a relatively robust MATLAB model for their bridge designs when we reach that point in the term.

In no way will engagement with my content negatively impact any students' grades. Dr. Barry and I will discuss the potential for incentive like extra credit, but that has not been determined as of **August 17 2023**.
